# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve response relevance by grounding answers in external documents and knowledge sources.

This repository covers:

- Fundamental concepts and components of RAG.
- Building a RAG system for interacting with documents.
- Advanced techniques to enhance retrieval and generation.
- Common pitfalls and challenges in naive RAG implementations.

## Features

- Document indexing and retrieval integration
- Generative language model for context-aware responses
- Examples and sample datasets
- Guidelines for optimizing RAG systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS
- Access to pretrained generative and retrieval models

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retrieval-augmented-generation.git
cd retrieval-augmented-generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
